# CastInspect

Cast Inspect is a smart quality control solution designed to enhance the manufacturing process by using AI-enabled cameras and IoT devices to monitor production and detect defects in real-time. Machine learning algorithms analyze images captured during the production process, automatically identifying defects or anomalies, such as cracks or scratches. This reduces reliance on manual inspections, leading to faster, more accurate, and cost-effective quality control while improving overall product quality and consistency.

<h6> How It Works: </h6>
<ul>
<li>Setup: AI cameras and sensors are strategically positioned along the production line.</li>
<li>Image Capture: As products move through the line, the system captures real-time images for analysis.</li>
<li>Defect Detection: Using machine learning, the system inspects for issues like cracks, dents, or scratches.</li>
<li>Alerts: When a defect is found, an alert is sent to the quality control team for investigation and action.</li>
<li>Continuous Learning: The AI system improves accuracy over time by learning from previous inspections, reducing false positives.</li>
</ul>
<h6>>Key Benefits: </h6>
<ul>
<li>Faster Inspections: Real-time analysis helps detect defects quickly, minimizing delays.</li>
<li>Improved Quality: Early detection prevents defective products from reaching customers, ensuring consistency.</li>
<li>Cost Efficiency: Reduced need for manual inspections and decreased waste through early detection lead to cost savings.</li>
<li>Actionable Insights: Data on defect patterns can guide process optimization, helping to minimize future defects.</li>
<li>By implementing Vision Transformer (ViT) technology on datasets like the Kaggle casting product image dataset, "Cast Inspect" offers a cutting-edge solution for modern manufacturing environments.</li>
</ul>
